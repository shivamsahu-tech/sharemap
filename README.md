ShareMap 🌍
Real-Time Group Location Sharing and Messaging Platform


🚀 Live Demo: https://sharemap.vercel.app

📋 Project Overview
ShareMap is a full-stack web application designed to allow you and your friends to share real-time locations of all group members on a single interactive map. The project also features an in-app group messaging system, where any member can send messages that pop up at their location icon, making it incredibly useful during group travels, event coordination, or group activities.

🔒 Data Privacy and Security
Your privacy is our priority! ShareMap only stores basic user data such as username, name, and password. It does NOT store any sensitive information like real-time locations or chat messages on the server. All data shared between clients is end-to-end encrypted using the crypto.js library, ensuring that your data remains confidential and secure. Messages and location data are encrypted on the client-side before being transmitted, and only authorized group members can decrypt it.

🎯 Key Features
Real-Time Location Sharing: Track the live locations of group members with precise and up-to-date information using the MapTiler API.
Group-Based Messaging: Send messages to group members, and watch them pop up dynamically at the sender’s location on the map, visible to everyone in the group.
Seamless Syncing: Powered by Socket.io, the app provides real-time updates for both location and messaging, ensuring a smooth, live experience.
Interactive Maps and UI: Switch between satellite view and OpenStreetMap layers, providing a flexible and engaging user experience.
Easy Group Joining: Share a unique URL or group code to invite others. No complex setup—just send the link or code, and you’re connected.
Enhanced Security: Each group is protected with a unique security key, ensuring that only authorized users can access and share data within the group.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend
React: Used for building the UI components and managing state.
Redux Toolkit: State management to handle global app state.
React Router DOM: For seamless navigation and routing.
Leaflet with MapTiler API: For interactive map visualization.
Socket.io-Client: For establishing real-time communication with the backend.
Backend
Node.js: The core runtime environment for server-side logic.
Express: Web framework for building the backend API.
MongoDB: Database for storing user data, group information, and authentication details.
Socket.io: Enables real-time bi-directional communication between server and clients.
Security and Encryption
crypto.js Library: Used for encrypting data on the client-side before transmission and decrypting it on the receiving end, ensuring end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
Deployment
Frontend: Deployed on Vercel for scalable and fast performance.
Backend: Hosted on Render, providing seamless backend API connectivity.
MapTiler API: Used for rendering the map and location services.
